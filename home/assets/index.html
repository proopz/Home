                    <p>As we are growing up in a situation where natural disasters are becoming common life events, we should consider the fact that we fail to control the effects of our actions in the case of harming nature. We as human beings are not leading towards the development of a good healthy life because of ourselves and our capitalistic mentality. So It is our responsibility to take care of every living being on the face of the Earth to maintain the balance of nature, Only then will we be able to live a healthy life. Let's unite with nature and save it to give our future generation better air to breathe, better water to drink, and better food to consume. I personally feel the urge to take the action that would help to go toward these results. This is our approach to developing some applications or providing some reports regarding crucial matters to awaken the people about the situation that we are in and let's start a revaluation to save the ecosystem.</p>

                    <p>To be honest, I feel as a human being that we have a moral responsibility to our mother nature and also to this human society. But, since the human race's revolution, we have forgotten that morality, and as a result, natural disasters are becoming more common and taking the lives of our animals and loved ones. So, to prevent these occurrences, we should take strong actions regarding their causes. I think we, as a future generation, have enough resources to analyse the causes and develop some solutions that will do good for both the people and the earth. So I, with my few friends, am trying to build some tools that I strongly believe will help people to save our mother nature and also help them to live a healthy life.</p>

                    <p>Hope everyone is doing well, staying safe and healthy. In this current world, where the value of data is increasing day by day, we need to learn about data awareness. I think basic "information literacy" is very important for present society. Be aware of your own data points, be aware of your digital identity, know your data rights, protest against data misuse.</p> <p>With Project-1.0 we have tried/ are trying to do something with different datasets where we will consider our work successful if there is some benefit to humanity. At last, take data seriously, maybe your data is nectar to others and remember the words of Tim O'Reilly - "Who has the data has the power."</p>
                    <p>Thank you, stay safe.</p>
